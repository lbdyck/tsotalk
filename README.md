# TSOTalk

TSOTALK is an attempt to create a way for TSO users to "talk"
with each other using the TSO `SEND` command.

Some caveats:

1. TSO `PROFILE Intercom` must be enabled
2. It only works for users in the same SYSPLEX
   - possibly only in the same JESPLEX
3. Quotes within the message text are not allowed.
